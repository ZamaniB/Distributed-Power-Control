    "In this method we consider the full behaviour of distributed agents without assuming they are connected from the initial time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumption 1 \n",
    "We do assume that initially total number of agents is known by each agent. Agents transmitting messages with an initial power level which either result in 2-way connections between them or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Increase Power Block \n",
    "Hence we need to add a behaviour that gradually increases the transmission power (if safe with respect to the local knowledge of enemy vehicle locations) until at least one 2-way conncetion is achieved. This will enable the following behaiour or will fail until the enemy configuration is changed, if at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumption 2\n",
    "Here we won't consider the hopeless situation where a 2-way conncetion is continuously not attained while increasing the power is continuously not safe.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Gossip (Consensus) Block\n",
    "Once at least one connection is achieved the agent needs to run a consensus algorithm to find out if the extended network enabled by its neighbours includes all the agents in the fleet, i.e. is connected. After the algorithm converges, and if still the network is not connected the agent will further increase it's transmission power (if safe with respect to the estimate semi global enemy information).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumption 3\n",
    "Again we won't consider the hopeless situation where a connected network is never attained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the agent has a connected network we will attempt optimising transmission power such that its connectivity is maintained and its signature is minimised with respect to the changing enemy locations (which it has an estimate for based on its consensus algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Behaviour Tree\n",
    "At any point, if the connectivity is lost based on the optimised decisions the behaviour needs to revert back to its previous safe connectivity build up behaviours. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will put these behaviours together in a Behaviour Tree architecture. For a good reference on behaviour trees and the symbology of the model please refer to: Colledanchise, Michele, and Petter Ã–gren. \"Behavior Trees in Robotics and AI, an Introduction.\" https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.00084.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The picture attached above includes the behaviour tree for the combined design as was explained before. The ellipse leaf nodes are conditions that return either success or faliour. The box leaf nodes are durative actions/algorithms that either return running (if they have not converged), success or failure. These responses need to be carefully and logically defined. The question-mark parent nodes of the tree are fallback blocks. The parent nodes continually tick their child nodes from left to right. The fallback parent will return success or running as soon as one child returns success or running and it will return failure if all childs return failure. The arrow parent box is a sequence block and will return failure/running as soon as one child returns failure/running and returns success if all childs return success.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Optimisation Block\n",
    "The Optimisation problem is defined as in the equations of the picture above. In the following we formalise that.\n",
    "The diagram below is used to explain the assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![LPD_legend.png](attachment:LPD_legend.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumption 4:\n",
    "Note that the previous assumptions imply that the optimisation block starts with a connected network topology. The additional assumption here is that red vehicle position variations are such that a connected modified network topology based on the previous step connected network topology is possible, i.e. the optimisation problem below stays feasible. Note that, this assumption is only used for continuing with the bevaviour defined in this block. If this assumption is violated the beviour tree shall revert back to the previous behaviours invoking the previous assumptions for existance of an alternative connected network toplogy. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "The connectivity constraints for vehicles $i$ with transmission power at $P_i$ at 2D coordinates $l_{i}$ with respect to blue vehicles $j$ in the desired neighbours set $\\mathcal{N}_i$ that are located at coordinates $l_j$ is   \n",
